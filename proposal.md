Game: WW1 Tank Avoidnace

## Repository
https://github.com/Xiaomi-Bread/Final-Project.git

## Description
I will be creating game with basic mechanics. As someone who is majoring in ANGM, I wish to go into game design and how is that my first ever game. In the name I called it WW1 Tank Avoidance. I want the player to have control over a WW1 Tank (mainly the Mark IV) and they ahve to control it to avoid the landscape or else it will be game over. 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- I mainly wanna feature the tank to be cartoonly and animated like it is moving. I have to upload a gif to same directory and write a        function for player to control with kets
- Feature 2
	- It will have a custom floor each time you enter a new game. I will try to have it be import random like use random color for the resolution and maybe even texture
- Feature 3 
	- Obsturctals will come at the player and have a collison feature so when collide it will be game over. Like the digital I will make it horizontal and add a script for player collison. (Tank) <- (Obstructals)
- Feature 4 
  - Maybe add a start feature, like press a button for the same to start. Use a Key function and a text instrustment. I am trying to feature that out. (All done in pygame and maybe more)

## Challenges
- A needed skill is how I am able to make gaps for the obstructals and how to make collide. (via Pygame)
- How to add an animated tank and have the obstructals to be art, So how to import it. 
- Adding a "GUI" to the game and also having it to work with a single click to work. (Via Pygame, maybe)

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Have all the things I mentioned to work. Like working start system. A animated tank, animated background or maybe a new custom background (Maps). And for the game to work as intended. Have all of the game mechanics 
Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Have a background that will change color per round, the tank isn't animated but there will work. Obstructals will work. Have normal game functions of a basic game. (like flappy bird)

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create an animated gif of the tank and the obstructals it will be facing. 
  2. Create the basis like the resolution and the very first background. 

- Week 2
  1. Add basic game mechnics like making the controls for the tanks. 
  2. Add critical components like collison. 

- Week N (Final)
  1. Add the changing of backgrounds 
  2. Polish if I wanna add random objectals and much more.
